        12/20: nothing lifts my mood like rain and mundane life. i write these
        because when it comes to non-quantitative facts my memory is awful. i
        started keeping track of everything i did this semester in a notebook:
        problem sets, essays, coffee/lunch/dinner dates, office hours,
        everything. just reading the bare facts of what i did that day reminds
        me of the circumstances around each event. i'll write in the designated
        column of the day, hangout with eric, but what we really did
        that day was walk to indian rock and watch the sunset surrounded by
        strangers and the smell of piss. a couple was making out. someone was
        smoking weed. a father took his children on a picnic and i wondered
        where their mother was. one couple must have been on their first date.
        the girl was quite disillusioned with postgrad life and the boy readily
        agreed. the sky looked like it could be a rothko painting, blue and
        orange. i wanted to lean into eric but at that moment at least i was too
        self-conscious. i'm quite surprised by how much i can remember when
        given the right ques and madeleines. we walked back to my
        studio in the dark and i offered eric some chocolate pretzels. tiff had
        gone home that weekend. there is so much more i'm not writing down. this
        was almost two months ago. i can recall the sensations and feelings but
        i can only write them down in this factual way and hope that in reading
        the words become more again.

        12/19: i've been thinking about the future recently. i'd
        like to try my hand at gardening. i think i'd enjoy it quite a bit.

        on 12/17: went for a walk at night and came across these shadows. one
        tree shade was sprouting velvet from its
        leaves. a stray cat let me pick her up and i almost got lost. it was
        much warmer in the hills than on campus. there's a long staircase on the
        west side of the hills with houses on either side. i sat in the shadows
        half way up and watched a woman climbing up and down the stairs below
        unloading groceries from her car. she didn't noticed me watching her.
        i would like to sleep there one day. it was quite warm and the lights
        were pretty. people enter their homes and don't come out again at night.
        i'm slowing losing the urge to smoke.
