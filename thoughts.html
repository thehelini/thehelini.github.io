        12/19: i've been thinking about the future recently. i'd
        like to try my hand at gardening. i think i'd enjoy it quite a bit.

        on 12/17: went for a walk at night and came across the
        most beautiful shadows. one tree shade was sprouting velvet from its
        leaves. a stray cat let me pick her up and i almost got lost. it was
        much warmer in the hills than on campus. there's a long staircase on the
        west side of the hills with houses on either side. i sat in the shadows
        half way up and watched a woman climbing up and down the stairs below
        unloading groceries from her car. she didn't noticed me watching her.
        i would like to sleep on there one day. it was quite warm and the lights
        were pretty. people enter their homes and don't come out again at night.
        i'm slowing losing the urge to smoke.
