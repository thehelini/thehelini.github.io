        6/24: i started my garden this month (garden in a sense). a peony from
        ryan, a mint for mixing cocktails, a little succulent i took from a plantbox after sneaking into
        a cafe one night, and an air plant from nathan. aren't they beauties?
        i'm recommitting to my (sort of) blog.

        1/13: bad picture of frank's office. why do they
        hang asian art in tiny hallways with bad
        lighting? the incongruency makes the place look more sad than it already
        is.

        1/4: walked into the kitchen this morning and saw a pile of ants.
        one time nathan came over and the whole
        time i was sprinkling cinnamon on ants hoping they would go away. a lot of
        childhood memories have been flitting through my head lately.

        12/25: today was the beginning of the first family road trip i can
        remember that didn't involve someone yelling. also finally found the
        moon and the slopes aren't nearly as packed as they were a year ago.

        12/21: i dread coming back to benicia. not because i don't want
        to but because i feel stuck here.
        public transportation is almost non-existent and
        all the homes on my street look identical. it looks like the
        fucking american dream over here: nice house, nice car, nice kids, nice
        dog, nice park, nice school, everything is so fucking nice it's awful,
        while the lighting in my room has that gross washed out tint of
        flourescent lights which reminds me of that painting of the diner. these
        houses don't even look good. everyone's obsessed with efficiency. i
        suppose there's more money in developing whole neighborhoods rather than
        individual lots but what happened to authenticity. i miss maryland. i
        miss brick and wood. i miss old neighborhoods where the trees have had
        time to shatter the sidewalks with their roots. i miss my home. i wish everything wasn't
        so plastic and shiny and perfect and new and shadowless.

        12/20: nothing lifts my mood like rain and the mundane. i write these
        because my memory is awful. i can't seem to remember anything unless i'm
        reminded of it first. it doesn't make sense. i started keeping track of
        everything i did this semester in a notebook: problem sets, essays,
        coffee/lunch/dinner dates, office hours, everything.
        i'll write in the designated column of the day, hangout with
        eric, but what we really did was walk to indian rock and watch the
        sunset surrounded by strangers and the smell of piss. a couple making
        out. someone smoking weed. a father and his children on a picnic and we
        wondered where their mother was. another couple must have been on their
        first date. the girl was quite disillusioned with postgrad life and the
        boy readily agreed. the sky looked like it could be a rothko painting,
        blue and orange. i wanted to lean into eric but at that moment at least
        i was too self-conscious. i'm quite surprised by how much i can remember.
        we walked back to my studio in the dark
        and i offered eric some chocolate pretzels. tiff had gone home that
        weekend. this was almost two months ago. there are more details left
        unsaid: the rock sat next to a house like neighbors, we came across
        'doctor no' written on the sidewalk -- a james bond reference, i picked a
        lemon and then dropped it, we left early because eric was hungry, we
        passed a street by a fountain where several nobel winners live, and so
        the list goes. i can recall the sensations and feelings but i can only
        write them down in this factual way and hope that in reading words
        become more.

        12/19: i've been thinking about the future recently. i'd like to try my
        hand at gardening. i think i'd enjoy it quite a bit.

        margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:3vh;margin-bottom:2vh;">
        on 12/17: went for a walk at night and came across these shadows. one
        tree shade was sprouting velvet from its
        leaves. a stray cat let me pick her up and i almost got lost. it was
        much warmer in the hills than on campus. there's a long staircase on the
        west side of the hills with houses on either side. i sat in the shadows
        half way up and watched a woman climbing up and down the stairs below
        unloading groceries from her car. she didn't noticed me watching her. no
        one ever looks up.
        i would like to sleep there one day. it was quite warm and the lights
        were pretty. people enter their homes and don't come out again at night.
        i'm slowing losing the urge to smoke.
