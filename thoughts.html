        12/31: recently, near the end of the day, i started thinking about how i
        felt throughout the day. it's harder than one might imagine, for me at
        least. there are only so many words we have for emotions and none of
        them do reality any justice. the only way i know how to describe my
        feelings is by building up the details around the event that made me
        feel a certain way but is that enough? i was always perplexed whenever
        anyone asked me how my day was and i never figured out why until
        recently: that question demands a qualitative answer. it asks me, on
        face value, to make a value judgement about my day, something i do but
        am not comfortable with because (1) what mechanism could i possibly use
        to accurately evaluate my entire day in a timely manner? it would take
        time to recall what happened that day and more time to think about
        whether the things that happened were overall good or bad or nuetral or
        what not. and even if i were to succeed in that, i would have to sum up
        those momentary values to get an answer to the the question how are you.
        i end up reducing an entire day to one value judgement which begs the
        question how accurate can that judgement be when the person hearing it
        has no way of knowing how much good is in the bad and how much bad is in
        the good? (2) even if i go on to say why my day was such a way the
        question itself still suggests that those reasons are ultimately
        reducible to the value judgement. the question how are you is suppose to
        be one of vulnerability, a way to let someone else into your
        perspective, but it ultimately fails in its aim because its triteness
        cements its status as a question demanding a value judgement. i asked
        tiff if she ever thought about how her days were and she told me she
        sometimes reflects on her day. if we could just change the casual,
        cursory nature of how are you to be one that provokes us into
        reflection.

        12/25: today was the beginning of the first family road trip i can
        remember that didn't involve someone yelling. also finally found the
        moon and the slopes aren't nearly as packed as they were a year ago.

        12/21: i always dread coming back to benicia. not because i don't want
        to but i feel stuck here. it's everything i dislike about surburban
        life: public transportation is almost non-existent, nothing is within
        decent walking distance and even if it was there isn't much to look at
        on your way unless you're a fan of the refinery or you like model homes,
        all the homes on my street look identical. it looks like the goddamn
        fucking american dream over here: nice house, nice car, nice kids, nice
        dog, nice park, nice school, everything is so fucking nice it's awful,
        while the lighting in my room has that gross washed out tint of
        flourescent lights reminding me of that painting of the diner. these
        houses don't even look good. everyone's obsessed with efficiency. i
        suppose there's more money in developing whole neighborhoods rather than
        individual lots but what happened to authenticity. i miss maryland. i
        miss brick and wood. i miss old neighborhoods where the trees have had
        time to fuck up the sidewalks. i miss my home. i wish everything wasn't
        so plastic and shiny and perfect and new and shadowless.

        12/20: nothing lifts my mood like rain and mundane life. i write these
        because my memory is awful. i can't seem to remember anything unless i'm
        reminded of it first. ironic right? i started keeping track of
        everything i did this semester in a notebook:problem sets, essays,
        coffee/lunch/dinner dates, office hours,everything. just reading the
        bare facts of what i did that day reminds me of the circumstances around
        each event. i'll write in the designated column of the day, hangout with
        eric, but what we really did was walk to indian rock and watch the
        sunset surrounded by strangers and the smell of piss. a couple making
        out. someone smoking weed. a father and his children on a picnic and i
        wondered where their mother was. another couple must have been on their
        first date. the girl was quite disillusioned with postgrad life and the
        boy readily agreed. the sky looked like it could be a rothko painting,
        blue and orange. i wanted to lean into eric but at that moment at least
        i was too self-conscious. i'm quite surprised by how much i can remember
        when making my own madeleines. we walked back to my studio in the dark
        and i offered eric some chocolate pretzels. tiff had gone home that
        weekend. this was almost two months ago. there are more details left
        unsadi: the rock sat next to a house like neighbors, we came across
        doctor no written on the sidewalk -- a james bond reference, i picked a
        lemon and then dropped it, we left early because eric was hungry, we
        passed a street by a fountain where several nobel winners live, and so
        the list goes. i can recall the sensations and feelings but i can only
        write them down in this factual way and hope that in reading words
        become more.

        12/19: i've been thinking about the future recently. i'd like to try my
        hand at gardening. i think i'd enjoy it quite a bit.

        on 12/17: went for a walk at night and came across these shadows. one
        tree shade was sprouting velvet from its
        leaves. a stray cat let me pick her up and i almost got lost. it was
        much warmer in the hills than on campus. there's a long staircase on the
        west side of the hills with houses on either side. i sat in the shadows
        half way up and watched a woman climbing up and down the stairs below
        unloading groceries from her car. she didn't noticed me watching her.
        i would like to sleep there one day. it was quite warm and the lights
        were pretty. people enter their homes and don't come out again at night.
        i'm slowing losing the urge to smoke.
