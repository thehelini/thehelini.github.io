    </br>most people don't really think about colors, or when they do its normally
        "do these colors match?" or "does this color look good?" most of the times
        we just take colors for granted. i mean when was the last time you spent more
        than one minute thinking about colors? through this project i hope for people
        to see colors in a different way than they normally would. i have created an
        interactive webpage for my project where users can build their own
        <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=piet+mondrian">Mondrian</a> inspired
        "paintings." the goal is to make people more conscious of color and the way
        colors interact with their environments, including but not limited to other
        colors as well as the people viewing them. i was in part inspired by Robert
        Haas' poem
        <em><a href="http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poem/item/20020/auto/0/THE-PROBLEM-OF-DESCRIBING-COLOR"
        target="_blank">The Problem of Describing Color</a></em>.
