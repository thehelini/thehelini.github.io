    </br>we never really consider colors, or when we do its usually less about the
        color itself and more about what that color signifies: how gray or green
        tinged chicken breasts shouldn't be consumed or how the purple spot on skin
        suggests one was in a physical altercation. In other words, we tend to take
        colors for granted. (of course, by we, i mean the general population: most
        of whom are not designers, painters, photographers and such who work and
        think with colors everyday.) query: can you
        remember the last time you thought about colors?
      </br>through this project i hope to put color in the forefront of our minds. i
        have created an interactive page where visitors can create things with
        varying shades of color as their building blocks. my goal is to make people
        conscious of color and the way colors interact with our environments.
        i was in part inspired by Robert Hass' poem
        <em><a href="http://www.poetryinternationalweb.net/pi/site/poem/item/20020/auto/0/THE-PROBLEM-OF-DESCRIBING-COLOR"
        target="_blank">The Problem of Describing Color</a></em>.
